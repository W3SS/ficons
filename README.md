### Motive

Font Awesome, by Dave Gandy, is a popular icon libary for websites and the web. This is because it was the first open-source project to do an icon font simply and elegantly. 

However, over the last 5 years the icons in the set have become a bit dated and over used. Therefore, we saw the opportunity to update the library while maintaining the simple and common-sense method for using Font Awesome icons.

To do this, we simply maintained the simple **fa-icon-name** class system and left Font Awesome icons as fallbacks if we don't provide a replacement. 

Doing this makes Ficons a "drop-in" replacement for Font Awesome, which means you can simply replace your CDN link to Font Awesome CSS with the CDN link to Ficons CSS.

> **TLDR** You can just replace your Font Awesome CDN link with the one from Ficons and everything should work the same, only better.
