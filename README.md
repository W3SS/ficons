## A Minimalist, Drop In Font Awesome Replacement

Ficons is a Simple, Open-Source, Drop-In Alternative for Font Awesome Icons.
Maintained by [The Fiction Team](https://www.fiction.com/).

Get started at [https://ficons.fiction.com](https://ficons.fiction.com)!

**Motive:**
Font Awesome, by Dave Gandy, is likely the most popular icon libary for websites and the web. This is because it was the first open-source project to do an icon font simply and elegantly. 

However, over the last 5 years the icons in the set have become a bit dated and over used. Therefore, we saw the opportunity to update the library while maintaining the simple and common-sense method for using Font Awesome. 

All Ficons icons use the same classname convention as Font Awesome. Making is a "drop-in" replacement for Font Awesome. **That means you can just replace your Font Awesome CDN link with the one from Ficons and everything should work the same.**

**Features:**

* Get over 200 new or replaced icons
* Minimal and more consistent redesign
* Simple, drop-in replacement for Font Awesome's 'fa-' class system
* Update your site or apps icons in 60 seconds
